# About
Founded in 2024 by your typical nerdy guitarist / engineer after working on more modern and generalized MIDI solutions for two years as a pass time, then another year full time. 

At SINE24 we strive to bring you audio equipment that will be both easy to use and creatively fruitful. The world always needs more music ! 

We're commited to using recycled materials in our products. We've found we can make good looking gear that's durable this way.
