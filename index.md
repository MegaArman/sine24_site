# About
Founded in Virginia in 2024 by your typical unsatisfied guitarist / engineer nerd after working on more modern and generalized MIDI solutions for two years as a hobby, then another year full time. 

At sine24 we strive to bring you audio equipment that will be both easy to use and creatively fruitful. The world always needs more music ! 

We're commited to using recycled materials in our products. We've found we can make good looking gear that's durable this way.
