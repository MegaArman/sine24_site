## MIDI MAGPIE
The MIDI MAGPIE turns your instrument into a **monophonic MIDI keyboard** that’s responsive enough to use in any live situation and very handy at home or in the studio. It converts audio to midi with no audible delay. It’s best suited for notes at or above an E2 (guitar, cello, flute, etc)
      
* Simple calibration for your instrument in under a minute

or even always 127
